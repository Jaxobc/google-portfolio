        <li><h4> Why did you use the Flowerboy album?</h4>
          <p> RNB is my favourite genre and the aesthetic of the Flowerboy album cover is amongst the best I have ever seen.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h4> How old are you? </h4>
          <p> I turned 20 on the 1st of June 2020. Being born in 2000 is elite. </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4> What is your favourite show? </h4>
          <p> I really enjoyed House of Cards and Black Mirror. Thought-provoking shows always keep me engaged. </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4> What is your favourite anime? </h4>
          <p> 
            There is no solid number one for me, so I'll just say Death Note. The protagonist was somewhat evil, it does not get better
            than that.

        <li><h4> What is your favourite book? </h4> 
          <p> 
            Nervous Conditions by Tsitsi Dangarembga was the first book I ever connected with. Being able to recognise the colloquial
            language and places where events took place was exciting. It may not seem like a big deal, but a lot of the books and movies
            we consume in Africa are based in unfamiliar contexts of the Western World.

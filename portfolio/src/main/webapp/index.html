      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Jacob Chidawaya, a Zimbawean that was born and raised in South Africa. I am a 
        rising sophmore at the University of Pennsylvania majoring in Computer Science and
        minoring in Philsophy and Consumer Psychology. This summer I am a Google Step intern
        looking to gain insight into a potential career path whilst developing my professional
        etiquette. 
      </p>

        I went to a choir school for three years where I was able to cultivate my creative 
        interests. After that I finished my high school career at an all boys boarding school 
        where sports were highly popular. These two experiences inspired the work I will be sharing
        in this portfolio. Flowerboy is my account of what Tyler The Creator's album "Flowerboy" 
        means to me and the impression it has had. Ballers is an image grid of my soccer interests
        with the teams/players that have been most influential for me.

      <h2>Flowerboy</h2>
      <p> 
        Amongst Tyler's albums my easy going demeanour is best matched by Flowerboy. Before the first 
        note is sound the album cover depicts a vivid scenery which is oddly soothing. The bright 
        background contrasts the figure standing with folded arms whilst facing away from the viewer. 
        The massive bees show that this is not realistic and verify the attractiveness of the Flowerboy. 
        I imagine that Tyler gave us a glimpse into his extraordinary imagination without allowing us 
        to loose sense of his calm character. The music continues to build the narrative he portrayed
        on the cover by by mixing a variety of songs which blend to share Tyler's current views. He is
        somehow composed on this album whilst discussing his depression, lonliness and love stories. 
        The legitimacy of his sentiment is conveyed in his unconventional chord progressions and ertaic
        developments. By not allowing us to know what comes next Tyler makes us experience his unstelled 
        feelings. The style is uniquely his own with inspiration drawn from the many artists he features. 
        This album remains amongst my favourite listens and I could play See You Again on repeat for 
        hours. I like to think that I could be described as a Flowerboy, both expressive and calm

      <h2>Ballers</h2>
      <p> 
        The following is a collection of players amd teams who have inspired my love for the game. 
        Soccer is the most popular sport in the world. This popularity means there are many boys 
        like me who grow up loving the game and wishing to one day ascend to the heights where 
        their skills can be admired alongside the greatest players of their generation. Football 
        stars receive contracts from major brands and can be seen in many adverts that are not 
        related to soccer. Their prowess on the field has allowed them to captivate billions of 
        fans across the world. Evidently, the World Cup is the most-watched overall live event 
        on television worldwide. Soccer brings nations together. The sport is a common language
        understood universally. The joys and heartache felt are a testiment of people's love for
        the beautiful game.
